----------------------

ReFlow is a fully automatic floating-point code extractor.
Given a [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com/) real-valued program and the target floating-point precision (single or double), ReFlow generates the corresponding floating-point C implementation.

ReFlow implements a code instrumentation to detect unstable conditionals (i.e., the floating-point computational flow diverges with respect to the ideal real number one) by over-approximating the conditional guards in the if-then-else statements.
The resulting transformed program emits a warning when an unstable test is detected.

The generated C code is annotated with [ACSL](https://frama-c.com/html/acsl.html) (ANSI/ISO C Specification Language
) contracts that relate the floating-point implementation with the real-valued program specification.
ReFlow relies on the static analyzer [PRECiSA](https://github.com/nasa/PRECiSA) to compute sound round-off error estimations and the corresponding PVS proof certificate that guarantee their correctness.

The annotated code can be input to the static analyzer [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/).
The WP plug-in has been customized to support the PVS certificates generated by PRECiSA in the proof of correctness of the C program. ReFlow also provides a collection of PVS proof strategies that to help discharge the VCs generated by Frama-C.

ReFlow supports a wide variety of operators, conditionals, let-in expressions, non-recursive function calls, bounded for-loops, and predicates.

# Installation

ReFlow runs on Linux and Mac OS X operating systems.

## Prerequisites

To build and install ReFlow you need:
- The [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) (version `>=8.10.7`) and
- its package manager [Cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/3.6/) (version `>=3.6.2.1`).
- `Make`
- `wget` or `curl` HTTP clients
- `git`
- `CMake`
- *C99/C++17* compilers

Alternatively, a *Dockerfile* is provided to create a container with all the previous prerequisites that can be used to build ReFlow.

To analyze the generated C program you need:
- [Why3 1.4.1](https://why3.lri.fr/)
- [Frama-C 24.0 Chromium](https://frama-c.com/fc-versions/chromium.html)

## Build

A *Makefile* is provided to automate the downloading and building of *Kodiak* and its dependencies, and to configure and build ReFlow.

 The only command that needs to be run from the folder containing the `Makefile` file is:
```sh
$ make
```

If you want to install ReFlow inside a container, a *Dockerfile* is provided. Given a standard *Docker* installation and the *ReFlow* repository path `<ReFlow-path>`,
the commands to install *ReFlow* inside the container are:
```sh
$ cd <ReFlow-path>
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ cd deps/precisa
$ docker build -t precisa-container .
...
$ docker run -v <ReFlow-path>:/reflow  -it precisa-container /bin/bash
docker$ cd reflow
docker$ make
...
docker$ echo "Now reflow is available for the current session"
docker$ reflow
...
```

# Automatic generation of stable C code from PVS

The input to ReFlow C are the following files:

* A program `example.pvs` composed of real-valued functions. In its current version, ReFlow accepts a subset of the language of the Prototype Verification System (PVS), including LET expressions, IF-THEN-ELSE constructions, function calls, and floating point values and operations such as: addition, multiplication, division, subtraction, floor, square root, trigonometric functions, logarithm, and exponential. For example:
   ```
   example: THEORY
   BEGIN

	example (X,Y: real) : real =
		IF (X >= 0 AND Y < 4)
		THEN IF (Y > 0)
			 THEN X+Y
			 ELSE X*Y
			 ENDIF
        ELSE X-Y ENDIF

   END example
   ```

* A file `example.input` containing initial ranges for the input variables of the program. For example:
   ```
   example(X,Y): X in [-10,10], Y in [0, 40]
   ```

The output is a C floating-point program `example.c` instrumented to detect unstable tests.
This program is annotated with ACSL contracts stating the relation between the floating-point program and the real number specification. This annotated program can be analyzed with the [Frama-C](https://frama-c.com/) static analyzer.

Besides, PVS certificates are provided for ensuring that all the unstable tests are detected.
These certificates can be automatically checked as explained [here](#How-to-verify-the-PVS-certificates).


## How to run ReFlow

We assume that `reflow` (the executable of ReFlow) is in the current directory.

To launch the round-off error analysis of ReFlow with the default parameters run:
```
$ ./reflow "example.pvs" "example.input"
```

- the first parameter is the path to the PVS program to be analyzed;
- the second one is the path to the file that indicates the initial values for the input variables of the input program;

### Command Line Options

- `--format FORMAT` where FORMAT can be double or single, indicating the target format of the floating-point C code. The default value is double precision.

## How to compile the generated C code

In order to compile and analyze the generated code, you will need the file [precisa_prelude.c](share/c/precisa_prelude.c).
Copy this file to your working directory.

To analyze the generated code you can use the script [run-framac.sh](tools/run-framac.sh).
This script assumes
1) there is an environment variable `REFLOW_HOME` containing the path to the local copy of this directory and
2) the `frama-c` executable is available from the directory where you are running the script.

For example,
```shell
% export REFLOW_HOME="/path/to/reflow/no/trailing/slash"
% cd my_example
my_example% ls
my_generated_code.c
my_example% cp $REFLOW_HOME/share/c/precisa_prelude.c .
my_example% $REFLOW_HOME/tools/run-framac.sh my_generated_code.c
```
